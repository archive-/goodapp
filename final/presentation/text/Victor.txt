A great thing about GoodApp is the amount of potential it has. For the future, we have many goals and milestone.
Firstly and most importantly, we're aiming be a part of the the app stores. Whenever a potential user visits an app page in the app store, it displays the respective GoodApp rating.
GoodApp is community driven. The bigger it gets, the better it gets. And being this close to our user base allows us to focus and tackle and most important issues at the moment. As soon as one of our user is victim of malicious activity, he or she can report and every other user is now warned.
Since our solution is built of individual parts and actions, we can add or upgradeâ€¦


All the tools and products we've listed so far in this presentation and in the demo are free or open source. All the other tools that we've used but haven't mentioned yet are also open source, most importantly Git for our version control.
