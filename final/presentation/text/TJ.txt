So why GoodApp?

An application doesn't just pop out of anywhere [slide change].

... And it certainly doesn't just suddendly turn bad either [slide change].
(well, for the most part)

[slide change]
TODO -- talk about app lifecycle a bit (long development, continued support after)

Who makes an app?

[show fragment]
This is a random application on the Apple app store.
why can't i click this? [move pointer to "Chair Entertainment Group, LLC"]

[slide change]
And android is slightly better but not THAT much different.

we can click here [show fragment]
and see what other apps they have developed
as well as visit their website.

how transparent! <lol>

[slide change]
goodapp wants developers to be accounted for

[show fragment]
they should have a rating

[show fragment]
and it should be public and visible

<breath a few seconds>

(pgp picture or something)
pgp is an interesting system.

using public and private key cryptography, i can ensure
that an email from my friend victor is indeeed from him.
if he's signed the email with his private pgp key,
i can check the email's authenticity by verifying the
signature with his public key.

[slide change]
here's linus's pgp key hosted on the mit pgp keyserver.
if i trust any of these people, i can rest assured that
this public key is in fact linus's because these people
have said so.

[slide change]
goodapp shares this concept of endorsements and trusts.

in the same way people can recommend others on services
like linkedin, developers can endorse each other on goodapp.

goodapp then uses various inputs to determine absolute
trust ratings for each developer thus giving insight
into the "goodness" of that developer's applications.

TODO -- fix transition
i'll now hand it over to jasper who will delve more deeply
into goodapp's components that make up this absolute rating.
